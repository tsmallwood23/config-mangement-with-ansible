Practice using Ansible as a configuration management tool.

I used Ansible playbooks to deploy a NGINX webserver, along with a custom application. Courtesy of the DevOps bootcamp https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp.

I also practiced using it alongside Terraform to learn how they can work in tandem.
